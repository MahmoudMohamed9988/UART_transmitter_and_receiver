# UART_transmitter_and_receiver
   UART is a digital communication protocol for two or more devices.
   Communication is done by sending and receiving data asynchronously between the transmitter and receiver.
   Being asynchronous, the UART does not need a common clock between the transmitter and receiver.
   Thus, connected devices can work independently.
